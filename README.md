# windowsMedias

Hello, my name is Maur√≠cio and I'm the owner of giordanoApps().

This is a little explanation about `windowsMedias` app.

## Installation

You just have to get an apache application with PHP extension enabled. Also you need to use a browser that supports CSS3 and HTML5.

Once you have those pre-requisites, you just need to clone it.

## Usage

The main idea is to have an powerfull library of songs using a stylish application.

### Situation

It's on beggining, so it's funcionallity are limited to display songs from /music dir and play it.

## Contribution

I'm open to any contribution and ideas.

You can reach me through my email address: `mauricio.c.giordano@gmail.com`

Thank you and enjoy it!
